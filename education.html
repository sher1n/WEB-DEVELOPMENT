                                        <h4>Ministry of Education Releases Report on Performance Grading Index 2.0 for States/UTs for the Year 2021-22</h4>
                                        <p>The Ministry of Education has released the Performance Grading Index (PGI) 2.0 for States/UTs for the year 2021-22.
                                                PGI 2.0 replaces the previous versions and focuses on qualitative assessment, digital initiatives, and teacher education.
                                                The structure comprises 73 indicators grouped into two categories: Outcomes and Governance Management.
                                                States/UTs are classified into ten grades, with Daksh being the highest achievable grade and Akanshi-3 being the lowest.
                                                PGI 2.0 aligns with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and aims to improve education outcomes and identify areas for intervention.
                                                The release of PGI 2.0 demonstrates the efficacy of the system in assessing and improving the education system.</p>

                                        <h4>Coimbatore School Education Department issues circular to private schools that allegedly asked for caste, religion in daily diary</h4>
                                        <p>Chief Educational Officer L. Sumathi said that the District Education Officer, C. Balraj, had issued the circular in-person to nine schools mentioned in the complaint they received from an organisation. All other private schools received the circular via mail on Tuesday , she added. As per data shared by the Department, there are 658 private schools in Coimbatore district.

                                                The circular read, “...a complaint has been received that the details related to caste and religion are mentioned in the homework notebook and profile form of the students studying in self-financing/matric/CBSE/nursery and primary/sports schools.”
                                                Teacher arrests in Coimbatore point to ineffectiveness of advisory committees
                                                “To promote equality and brotherhood among students, the following school principals are informed that the caste and religious identities, that hinder the complete development of the children in this age of scientific progress, should not be mentioned in the homework notebook and profile of the school students from this academic year (2023-2024),”
                                                 the Department instructed in the circular.</p>

                                <h4>Yes, AI could profoundly disrupt education. But maybe that’s not a bad thing</h4>
                                <p>ducation strikes at the heart of what makes us human. It drives the intellectual capacity and prosperity of nations. It has developed the minds that took us to the moon and eradicated previously incurable diseases. And the special status of education is why generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are likely to profoundly disrupt this sector. This isn’t a reflection of their intelligence, but of our failure to build education systems that nurture and value our unique human intelligence.
                                        We are being duped into believing these AI tools are far more intelligent than they really are. A tool like ChatGPT has no understanding or knowledge. It merely collates bits of words together based on statistical probabilities to produce useful texts. It is an incredibly helpful assistant.                                                                       
                                        But it is not knowledgable, or wise. It has no concept of how any of the words it produces relate to the real world. The fact that it can pass so many forms of assessment merely reflects that those assessments were not designed to test knowledge and understanding but rather to test whether people had collected and memorised information.                                        
                                        AI could be a force for tremendous good within education. It could release teachers from administrative tasks, giving them more opportunities to spend time with students. However, we are woefully equipped to benefit from the AI that is flooding the market. It does not have to be like this. There is still time to prepare,
                                         but we must act quickly and wisely.</p>

                                <h4>CM bats for artificial intelligence in higher education curriculum</h4>
                                <p>Vijayawada: Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy highlighted the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) and stressed the need to include it in the curriculum.
                                        During a meeting with senior officials of the education department and vice-chancellors of universities at his Tadepalli camp office on Thursday, the chief minister told them to think of the steps required to “fill the gap between our goals and achievements in the field of education” in the backdrop of the changes that the world is experiencing.
                                        “From steam engine to electricity to computers, we remained followers without having a say in their creation,” he said, adding that the world is now witnessing a fourth revolution in the form of AI.
                                        Pointing out that the vice-chancellors play a key role in higher education, he said they should think of adopting a two-pronged strategy to move along with the emerging technologies.
                                        While adopting AI into the education system for improving teaching methods and learning skills, students should also be imparted with the AI creating skills and it should become the part of curriculum, he said.
                                        “We should be a part of the fourth revolution becoming its creators and not remain just its followers. If we take right steps at the right time, we will become part of the emerging technologies. As AI grows, one section grows as its creators and another section follows it. We should become its creators,” he added.</p>

                                <h4>Chandrayaan-3: India launches rocket to land spacecraft on moon</h4>
                                <p>India’s space agency has launched a rocket that will attempt to land a spacecraft at the lunar south pole, an unprecedented feat that would advance India’s position as a major space power.
                                        Television footage on Friday showed the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) LVM3 launch rocket blast off from the country’s main spaceport at Sriharikota in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, leaving behind a plume of smoke and fire.
                                        Applause and cheers swept through mission control at Satish Dhawan Space Centre, where the ISRO engineers and scientists celebrated as they monitored the launch of the spacecraft.
                                        Thousands of Indians cheered outside the mission control centre and waved the national flag as they watched the craft rise into the sky.                                        
                                        “Congratulations India. Chandrayaan-3 has started its journey towards the moon,” ISRO Director Sreedhara Panicker Somanath said shortly after the launch</p>
