                                        <h4>How Karnataka Results Will Impact Tamil Nadu Politics</h4>
                                        <p>Congratulating the victorious Congress ally over its Karnataka poll victory, Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister M K Stalin promptly tweeted: 'The unjustifiable disqualification of Rahul Gandhi as MP, misusing investigative agencies against political opponents, imposition of Hindi, and rampant corruption have echoed in the minds of the people of Karnataka.'

                                                The voters of Karnataka 'have upheld the Kannadiga pride by teaching a befitting lesson to the BJP's vindictive politics... The landmass of Dravidian family stands clear of the BJP,' Stalin said, and added in the same vein: 'Now, let us all work together to win 2024 to restore democracy and Constitutional values in India.'
                                                
                                                Stalin also telephoned Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge, for whom it was a personal victory, he being a native of Karnataka, and also Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, apart from P Siddaramaiah and D K Shivakumar, the two party leaders who made it happen, setting aside their differences for a while.
                                                
                                                In tweeting his happiness over Congress's victory in Karnataka, and more so against the BJP's 'vindictive politics', Stalin seemed to have forgotten a couple of facts.</p>

                                        <p>Amid rumours of his political entry, Tamil superstar Vijay reportedly held a meeting with the office-bearers of his official fans association Vijay Makkal Iyakkam (VMI) at his Panaiyur office in Chennai on Tuesday. The meeting was organised to discuss his future as an actor and a politician, during which he informed the gathering that he would quit movies if he entered politics.

                                                “He has told us that he will not act in films if he enters politics and that he will not enter politics while he is making movies,” The Hindu quoted a VMI office-bearer as saying. According to India Today, rumours are rife that Vijay will go on a padayatra across Tamil Nadu before the release of Leo.</p>

                                        According to insiders, the current occupants of the property, the three-time CM’s ex-MP son Sandeep Dikshit and his family, are planning to move out and had put out information to this effect which came to the notice of Rahul’s office leading to an inquiry.

                                <h4>Maharashtra News Live Updates: Ajit Pawar gets Finance portfolio in Maharashtra cabinet expansion</h4>
                                <p>Maharashtra Politics Live Updates (July 14): Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar was given the Finance portfolio in the state cabinet expansion, while NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal secured the Food and Civil Supply portfolio. The cabinet expansion comes 12 days after nine MLAs of the NCP, including Ajit Pawar, were sworn in as ministers in the present Eknath Shinde-Devendra Fadnavis government.

                                        In other news, the Supreme Court today issued a notice on a plea of Uddhav Thackeray-led faction of Shiv Sena seeking direction to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar to take an expeditious decision on the disqualification petitions pending against rebel MLAs led by Eknath Shinde. The SC has sought a response to the plea in two weeks, ANI reported.
                                        
                                        The Maharashtra cabinet expansion and distribution of cabinet portfolios is “99 percent likely” by today, Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Shirsat said on Thursday. Shiv Sena (UBT) responded by saying that the faction led by CM Eknath Shinde will not get any Cabinet berths.</p>
