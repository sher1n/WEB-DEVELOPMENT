                                        <h4>Disappointed with Rohit Sharma’s captaincy</h4>
                                        <p>WHEN ROHIT Sharma took over India’s captaincy last February, after a tumultuous end to Virat Kohli’s reign, the legendary Sunil Gavaskar was among those who expected much from him. Since then, India failed to qualify for the T20 World Cup final in Australia, lost the World Test Championship final, and did poorly in a Test series in South Africa.
                                          The series of reverses has left Gavaskar disappointed with Rohit’s captaincy and he has also asked for more accountability for the coaching staff of Rahul Dravid, Vikram Rathour and Paras Mhambrey.Speaking at The Indian Express Idea Exchange earlier this week, Gavaskar said, “I expected more from him (Rohit). In India it is different, but when you do well overseas that is really the test. That is where he has been a little disappointing. 
                                          Even in the T20 format, with all the experience of the IPL, hundreds of matches as captain, with a mix of best IPL players not being able to get to the finals has been disappointing.”“They should be asking questions, ‘Why did you field first?’ Okay, it was explained at the toss that it was overcast and all. The question after that should be, ‘You didn’t know about Travis Head’s weakness against the short ball?’ Why was the bouncer employed only when he had scored 80 runs. You know, the moment Head came in to bat, in the commentary box, we had Ricky Ponting saying, ‘Bounce him, bounce him.’
                                           Everyone knew about it but we didn’t try.”</p>

                                        <h4>‘When we meet Australia, we would need higher levels than what we face in ISL’: Sunil Chhetri on the need to have longer camp before Asian Cup</h4>
                                        <p>Echoing the voices of coach Igor Stimac and goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, India captain Sunil Chhetri has called for an extended training camp ahead of the Asian Cup in January next year.

                                                Led by Chhetri, the Indian team has stayed unbeaten this year so far and a key reason for that has been attributed to long training camps where Stimac has been able to drill his ideas as well as worked on the team’s fitness.
                                                
                                                India are in Group B of the Asian Cup, along side Australia, Syria and Uzbekistan. “See, for a team like ours which will face Australia, Syria and Uzbekistan; we need it.
                                                 That is why both the gentlemen have spoken about it, and I really hope we get it,” Chhetri said on Sunday.Explaining why a longer camp is needed, Chhetri said: “When you are playing the ISL, all the boys will be used to the level of ISL – which is the premium level in our country. But let us be honest to ourselves, when we meet Australia, we would need a couple, if not more, levels higher than what we are facing in ISL. And that is the reason why when we meet together and train together, it will help us. So this is one reason why we need a longer camp.

                                                 “And to take that forward, it will also be great to face one of the top seven teams to play a friendly. Suppose we get Iran, Japan, or Saudi Arabia to play a match before meeting Australia in the Asian Cup then that will give us a very good picture, and we will be a little bit more ready than we will be if we do not play those top seven teams.
                                                  This is my wish, but the coach will take a call on whom we play,” he said.</p>

                                        <h4>PCB Chairman To Push For Pakistan's World Cup Matches At Neutral Venues In ICC Meeting</h4>
                                        <p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) acting chairman Zaka Ashraf will push for the country's ODI World Cup matches at neutral venues at the ICC meeting in Durban this week, the Minister for Inter-Provincial Coordination (Sports), Ehsan Mazari, has said. "Zaka Ashraf will bring up the issue of why can't Pakistan's matches in the World Cup be played at neutral venues when the Indian team can't travel to Pakistan for the Asia Cup," he said. 
                                                India has refused to play its Asia Cup matches in Pakistan owing to geopolitical tensions, and after months of speculation around the continental tournament, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) announced that the event will be staged in a
                                                 hybrid model with four games in Pakistan and nine in Sri Lanka from August 31 to September 17.However, the PCB recently conveyed to the ICC and the BCCI that the national team's participation in the World Cup is subject to government clearance due to the tense relations between the two countries.
                                                 Ashraf and the PCB chief operating officer, Salman Taseer are in Durban to attend the ICC meetings where they are expected to discuss India's refusal to send its team to Pakistan citing security reasons.
                                                 Mazari also claimed that, like him, some other members of the special committee, formed by Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to recommend whether the national team should travel to India for the World Cup, also felt in their personal capacities that it was time Pakistan took a strong
                                                 stance on India refusing to tour the country.</p>

                                <h4>Stokes has 'no hesitation' that England can win the Ashes from here</h4>
                                <p>Ben Stokes, the England captain, is confident that England can regain the Ashes following their three-wicket win over Australia, at Headingley, on Sunday. Having lost the first two Tests, England needed to win all the remaining games of the five-match series in order to win back the urn. The England captain said he had 'no hesitation' that they can win the series from hereon.

                                        Since the 1936-37 series Down Under, when the Don Bradman-led Australia won the series, no team has won the Ashes after being 2-nil down. Harry Brook's 75 helped England over the line at Leeds on the fourth day in a tricky run-chase, but they will have to beat Australia at Old Trafford and Oval in the next two games, in what has so far been a tightly-contested series, in order to make the hope come true.
                                        
                                        "Another down-to-the wire game," Stokes admitted after the game. "Nice to get over the line and keep our hopes alive.</p>

                                <h4>The Ashes: England scrape home in third Test to keep series alive</h4>
                                <p>To rippling applause of the nervous Leeds crowd, Chis Woakes scrunched Mitchell Starc through point to wrap arguably the most enormous victory of the Bazball era. It was their moment of benediction in the Ashes, the validation of their principles, and a loud statement that there is considerable steel beneath the carefreeness of their methods.

                                        This was far from a crushing win, a pursuit of 251 runs on a surface without devils with just three wickets to spare, but one that England simply could not afford to lose.
                                        
                                        The celebrations spoke more eloquently of the significance of the moment than words. Woakes and Mark Wood, two protagonists of the Leeds script, tightly embraced each other in the middle of the pitch. Ben Stokes and other colleagues rushed on to celebrate euphorically, releasing all their stifled nervous energy. 
                                        Though they are still trailing the series, though the win was more a scrape than a stroll, the victory could transform the series and careers, and could shape their legacies. At Old Trafford, in nine days’ time, 
                                        they could be an unstoppable force.</p>

                                <h4>Lakshya Sen wins Canada Open</h4>
                                <p>Lakshya Sen saved four game points in the second after taking the first to claim the Canada Open Super 500 at Calgary on Sunday. The six straight points he scored to win the championship showed the mental stranglehold he held over Chinese Li Shifeng throughout the game to win 21-18, 22-20 in 50 minutes.

                                        Adding extra acceleration onto his flat drives, pouncing on every short lift and playing some ridiculously tight shots at the net, Sen went on to win his second Super 500 title of his career after the India Open, beating the reigning All England champion.
                                        
                                        Sen took a 6-2 lead in the opener and zealously guarded it throughout the first set though Shifeng levelled at 15-all. Injecting pace into his returns, Sen would set up winners each time a loose shuttle floated his way as he showed the ability to collect points in a cluster. Even at 15-all, Sen went on the offensive straightaway with three quick points to not give away the initiative. 
                                        Winning the opener gave him the mental edge over Shifeng in a match where both played at a punishing pace of rallies.</p>

                                        <p>Victoria Azarenka said it “wasn’t fair” that she was booed at Wimbledon after her loss to Ukrainian rival Elina Svitolina on Sunday.
                                        Azarenka, who’s from Belarus, had just lost a third-set tiebreaker and — knowing that Svitolina does not shake hands with Russian and Belarusian players after matches in protest of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — walked directly to the umpire to shake hands.
                                        The two-time Grand Slam champion also seemed to give a slight wave to Svitolina, who won 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (9).But as she gathered her equipment and began walking off No. 1 Court — where the crowd had been rooting for Svitolina — boos rained down.
                                      “I can’t control the crowd. I’m not sure that a lot of people were understanding what’s happening,” Azarenka said, suggesting the crowd had been drinking.

                                        <h4>Andrey Rublev gets to the ball and sets up the win to reach Wimbledon quarterfinals</h4>
                                        <p>Andrey Rublev ran to his right, sized up the distance to the ball and then did the incredible.

                                                Diving through the air while hoping beyond hope, Rublev pulled off the shot of the Wimbledon tournament Sunday by somehow swiping the ball back over the net for a forehand winner from behind the baseline — a winner that set up match point and a spot in the quarterfinals.
                                                
                                                “Probably it was the most lucky shot ever. It just was luck,” Rublev said on court after reaching the second week at the All England Club for the first time. “I don’t think I can do it one more time.” 
                                                Rublev ended up beating Alexander Bublik 7-5, 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-7 (5), 6-4, taking the fifth set after failing to convert two match points earlier in the match.The seventh-seeded Russian became the ninth active male player to reach the quarterfinals at all four Grand Slams.
                                                 But he has never gone further at any of them.To reach the semifinals at Wimbledon, Rublev may have to face seven-time champion Novak Djokovic. 
                                                 The 23-time Grand Slam champion was scheduled to play Hubert Hurkacz later Sunday on Centre Court.</p>

                                        <h4>It’s all popping off: Umpire warns fans not to uncork champagne during serve</h4>
                                        <p>Tens of thousands of champagne bottles are opened during the Wimbledon Championships every year but on Sunday one chair umpire politely asked patrons to keep them corked, at least until the players on court had served.
                                                As action got underway between Anastasia Potapova and Mirra Andreeva on Court Three, one fan decided to mark Middle Sunday by uncorking a bottle of champagne that burst the bubble in the third-round contest between the two Russians.
                                                “Ladies and gentlemen, please, if you are opening a bottle of champagne, don’t do it as the players are about to serve,” Australian umpire John Blom said on the microphone for all to hear.
                                                Potapova, who was about to serve, stopped to listen to the announcement before nodding her head in approval with a smile, amid scattered applause.
                                                In 2019, a similar announcement was made by an umpire when a champagne cork flew on to the court during a match between Benoit Paire and Jiri Vesely</p>
