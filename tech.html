                                        <p>When Twitter, in November last year, fired thousands of employees without prior notice, the world was shocked as well as appalled. However, little did they know that soon, many companies would be carrying out large-scale layoffs leaving millions of families across the world without a means of livelihood. After all, layoffs never effect just one person, entire
                                                 families get affected.</p>

                                        <h4>The Biggest Apple Products We're Still Expecting in 2023</h4>
                                        <p>With the introduction of its Vision Pro headset, the 15-inch MacBook Air and new Mac desktops, Apple has already had a busy year when it comes to product launches. But if history offers any clue, there's still plenty more to come in 2023, potentially including a USB-C-equipped iPhone 15 and the Apple Watch Series 9. 
                                                As for other products like AirPods, the Apple TV and the iPad, Bloomberg reports we likely won't see major changes to those product lines this year. But Apple could launch a USB-C charging case for the AirPods Pro to match the iPhone's switch to USB-C, according to a more recent report from Bloomberg. More broadly, Apple is reportedly working on new health features for AirPods like temperature and hearing detection, Bloomberg also said, although those additions aren't expected to arrive for months or years.                                                 
                                                While Vision Pro is Apple's most significant new product announcement in years, the iPhone 15 may also make a bigger impression than usual if Apple does decide to make the switch to USB-C. It would signal the first time in more than a decade that you might need a different charger for your iPhone.

                                        <p>This year's two biggest tech events are still pending. Apple is expected to announce its latest iPhone 15 series in September this year, whereas Google is tipped to bring its new Pixel 8 series phones in October, which is its usual launch cycle. Both companies are yet to confirm the exact launch date for the upcoming 5G phones, but leaks have painted a good picture. Here, we will be taking a look at the upcoming Pixel phone. Ahead of the event, the price of the Pixel 8 smartphone has been leaked online, leaving very little to imagine before the launch.
                                         Here is all we know.</p>

                                <h4>Tesla resumes India-entry talks with new factory proposal</h4>
                                <p>The proposition comes after India last year refused to accept Teslaâ€™s request to reduce import tax on cars, which can go up as high as 100 percent on CBUs costing above $40,000. India wanted Tesla to build cars locally, whereas the carmaker wanted to test the waters first with imports, and the discussions ended in an impasse.

                                        While Tesla did not broach the subject of reduction of import taxes with officials in its latest discussion, it suggested establishing a factory, without offering details on either the location or the investment, a person in the know told Reuters on condition of anonymity. There were talks on which models could potentially be offered in India and even the scope of setting up a battery manufacturing plant in the future.
                                        
                                        Senior executives from Tesla also spoke to the government on local sourcing of components among other matters, the newswire had reported earlier. Tesla reportedly also sought advice on how to avail of the local Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. However, Tesla has not yet submitted any
                                         written proposal on the Indian market so far</p>

                                <h4>Windows 11 23H2 coming this fall as a small enablement package</h4>
                                <p>"Do you remember updating from Windows 10, version 1903 to 1909? Or how you've managed recent updates beginning with Windows 10, version 20H2 through 22H2? It will be that simple," said Windows Servicing and Delivery Manager Jason Leznek.

                                        "Moreover, since both versions share the same source code, you don't need to worry about application or device compatibility between the versions."
                                        
                                        Leznek advises all users to switch to Windows 11 22H2 before releasing the 23H2 feature update. 
                                        
                                        This ensures a faster upgrade process and less downtime, as previous versions will not receive the enablement package through Windows Update, and manual installation is impossible.
                                        
                                        Once you upgrade to Windows 11 22H2, you can deploy the 23H2 enablement package via Windows Server Update Services, Windows Update for Business, or Windows Autopatch.
                                        
                                        "The eKB is not available on Volume Licensing Service Center. Media packages contain the complete Windows 11 operating system," Leznek added..</p>

                                <h4>Google rolls out AI chatbot Bard to Europe and Brazil, adds more languages</h4>
                                <p>Alphabet said it is rolling out its artificial- intelligence chatbot, Bard, in Europe and Brazil on Thursday, the product's biggest expansion since its February launch and pitting it against Microsoft -backed rival ChatGPT.
 
                                        Bard and ChatGPT are human-sounding programs that use generative artificial intelligence to hold conversations with users and answer myriad prompts.
                                 The products have touched off global excitement tempered with caution.Companies have jumped onto the AI bandwagon, investing billions with the hope of generating much more in advertising and cloud revenue. Earlier this week, billionaire Elon Musk also launched his long-teased artificial-intelligence startup xAI, whose team includes several former engineers at Google, Microsoft and OpenAI.
 
                                 Google has also now added new features to Bard, which apply worldwide</p>
