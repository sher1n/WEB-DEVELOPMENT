                                        <h4>Adam Warlock Proves Marvel Can Fix The MCU Fantastic Four's Biggest Problem</h4>
                                        <p>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3's depiction of Adam Warlock proves the MCU will be able to avoid the biggest concerns regarding Marvel's Fantastic Four. With Marvel Studios reacquiring the rights to The Fantastic Four thanks to Disney's purchase of 20th Century Fox in 2019, the First Family is set to debut in the MCU with a film that's currently in development from director Matt Shakman. However, 
                                                Adam Warlock is a great example that shows fans shouldn't be worried about the imminent new team of MCU heroes.
                                                A predominant worry is that a debut for the Fantastic Four this late in the game for the MCU may result in problematic depictions for Reed Richards (Mister Fantastic), Ben Grimm (The Thing), Sue Storm (The Invisible Woman), and Johnny Storm (The Human Torch). However, those worries should be quelled thanks to Adam Warlock's MCU depiction as played by actor Will Poulter. After all, Adam technically should have been introduced into the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise and MCU continuity much sooner as well.

                                        <h4>Every John Wick 5 Update Makes The "Planned" Keanu Reeves Sequel More Confusing</h4>
                                        <p>John Wick: Chapter 4 had the perfect ending to the popular action franchise, but despite the protagonist's fate, there's a lot of talk about John Wick: Chapter 5. The fourquel saw John Wick (Keanu Reeves) once again running for his life, this time across five different countries, but it finally came to an end when he was forced into a duel with Caine (Donnie Yen), who used to be one of his allies. Caine fatally wounded John, but right before the titular assassin died, he seemed at peace, 
                                        and he was then buried in New York with the headstone reading, "Loving Husband."Despite the fact that John Wick, who has become one of the most beloved action heroes ever, dies at the end of John Wick: Chapter 4, this conclusion never felt morbid. John's death was inevitable ever since he came out of retirement in the first movie. However, despite John's death, Lionsgate has still announced John Wick: Chapter 5 is in development, alongside a ton of other John Wick spinoff movies and shows. 
                                        It's hard to see how the franchise can continue, especially with John as the protagonist once again. John Wick: Chapter 5 could risk undoing John Wick: Chapter 4's perfect ending, and director Chad Stahelski seems to agree.</p>

                                <h4>9 Versions Of Spider-Man Still Missing From The Spider-Verse Movies</h4>
                                <p>Many versions of Spider-Man were introduced in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, but there are still several that haven't been adapted into the smash-hit franchise. 2018's Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse debuted several different versions of Spider-Man in Sony's animated franchise, but its 2023 sequel featured a veritable army of Spider-People, adapted from various Spider-Man-centric media. While Miles Morales has now come into contact with dozens of interdimensional Spider-People, there are still many more that haven't yet made their way to the franchise, though this could change when Spider-Man:
                                 Beyond the Spider-Verse hits theaters.Peter B. Parker's Spider-Man, Gwen Stacy's Spider-Woman, Peter Porker's Spider-Ham, Peter Parker's Spider-Man Noir, and Peni Parker's SP//dr joined Miles Morales for Into the Spider-Verse, dragged into Earth-1610 by Wilson Fisk's multiverse collider. Each of them returned for the 2023 sequel, but Across the Spider-Verse debuted many more Spider-People, too, coming together to form the Spider Society, a group of multiversal Spider-People led by Miguel O'Hara's Spider-Man 2099, tasked with protecting the stability of the multiverse. Even though some familiar favorites were introduced in Across the Spider-Verse,
                                  there are still several versions of Spider-Man that are missing.</p>

                                <h4>Alita: Battle Angel 2 & 3 Seemingly Confirmed By James Cameron</h4>
                                <p>After years of uncertainty, producer James Cameron has seemingly confirmed that Alita: Battle Angel 2 and a third film are actually moving forward. Released in 2019 director Robert Rodriguez's Alita: Battle Angel serves as an adaptation of Japanese manga Gunnm
                                 (Battle Angel Alita, in English) by Yukito Kishiro. The film earned generally positive reviews and was a lukewarm success at the box office but two planned sequels have thus far failed to come 
                                 to fruition.Now, however, in a recent interview with Forbes regarding why he chose to sell his California mansion, Cameron, in his explanation, seemingly reveals that multiple Alita: Battle Angel sequels are happening. The producer doesn't reveal any details or timelines, but development will presumably 
                                 take place between his work on the three remaining Avatar sequels.</p>

                                <h4>Harrison Ford Breaks A 24-Year Disney Record With Indiana Jones 5</h4>
                                <p>With Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Harrison Ford broke an unusual Disney record. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was delayed so long, the press surrounding the fourth entry constantly jabbed fun at Ford's age. Little did those writers know that the star would return one last time 15 years later for the fifth entry Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. This installment finds Indiana team with his morally dubious goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) as they chase after Indiana 
                                Jones 5's titular time travel MacGuffin, which is also being sought by Mads Mikkelsen's Nazi villain Voller.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny's previews made constant reference to the opening sequence, where a de-aged Ford fights Nazis on a train. While the de-aging tech used during this sequence is impressive, and some of the best it has looked, it still has a waxy, unnatural look in many shots. Storywise, this opening isn't all that essential either, and Dial of Destiny becomes more interesting when it focuses
                                 on the fact Indy is an old man and explores his regrets and legacy.</p>

                                        <h4>Iron Man’ Robert Downey Jr admits he was concerned about the effect Marvel movies were having on his acting skills</h4>
                                        <p>Actor Robert Downey Jr has been semi-retired after starring in his final Marvel movie, Avengers: Endgame, in 2019. After that, he attempted to launch a new franchise for himself with Dolittle, but the movie ended up bombing, and pushed RDJ further away from acting. In a new interview, he spoke about his years playing around in the Marvel Cinematic Universe sandbox, and admitted that working on those movies made him worried about losing his acting skills.
                                                Robert Downey Jr spoke to The New York Times ahead of the release of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, in which he plays a supporting role. He was asked directly if playing Iron Man in multiple Marvel movies across more than a decade made him worry about his skills, and he said, “Yes. A hundred percent, and I knew there was a point where Chris Nolan was endorsing, let’s work those other muscles, but let’s do it while rendering you devoid of your usual go-to things.” He was referring to his usual ‘fast-talking’ acting style, 
                                                which he perfected during his time as Iron Man.</p>

                                        <h4>Pixar Fights Back: Elemental Sets Disney Box Office Record In Fourth Weekend</h4>
                                        <p>Elemental is continuing to show major growth at the worldwide box office. The Pixar movie, which opened in theaters on June 16, is a contemporary romance set in a city populated with anthropomorphic versions of the elements fire, water, earth, and air. The movie turned out a massively disappointing $29.6 million opening weekend but, despite grim projections, has continued to maintain a hold on the box office, sticking around on the
                                         chart and slowly bolstering its gross under the radar.Per Box Office Mojo, the Elemental box office is continuing its recovery this weekend with an additional $30 million in international markets. This brings its worldwide total to $251.9 million, a total that didn't seem quite feasible as of mid-June. This puts it ahead of last year's Pixar flop Lightyear ($226.4 million worldwide) and places it on a trajectory to surpass Disney's 
                                         Encanto ($256.8 million worldwide) to become Disney's biggest animated hit since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                                        <h4>Wednesday Season 2: Is it coming to Netflix in 2023?</h4>
                                        <p>Seldom has any spin-off matched the popularity and acclaim of its original. Wednesday is not only an exception of the same, but it has also surpassed The Addams Family in terms of its exponential popularity. An infallible amalgamation of dark comedy with romance, and indelible dance moves with Gothic monochrome fashion, Wednesday exceeds over 752,000,000 million hours. It would have been surprising if the show wasn’t renewed at all. However, we do know that Netflix seldom surprises its audience in this way. As per the streaming giant’s data:
                                                “The series broke the record for the most hours viewed in a week for an English-language TV series on Netflix – not once, but twice – when it debuted in the #1 spot with a record-breaking 341.23M hours viewed, and again in its second week with a staggering 411.29M hours viewed.”
                                                Tim Burton’s directorial debut, Wednesday piqued the excitement of the readers the moment Netflix released the first look of Jenna Ortega in the iconic Gothic costume of Wednesday Addams. Tim Burton is associated with the project as both a producer and a director.
That being said, fans are now perched on the edge of their seats ever since Netflix’s dark comedy was renewed for a second season. Be that as it may, there has been no announcement regarding the return date of the show.
