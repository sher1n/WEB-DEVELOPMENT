                                        <h4>Delhi Has Seen 30% Improvement In Air Quality: Environment Minister</h4>
                                        <p>New Delhi: While air pollution is steadily rising across the country, the national capital has witnessed a 30 per cent improvement in its air quality, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said on Sunday.
                                                Gopal Rai was speaking at the launch of the annual sapling plantation drive from the campus of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute here.                                        
                                                During the drive, which usually begins during the monsoon, saplings will be planted across the Delhi to increase the city's green cover.
                                                "Air pollution in Delhi has reduced by 30 per cent while it has steadily increased in the rest of the country," the minister said at the launch of the drive.
                                                Gopal Rai also launched an online portal to allow Delhi residents to book free saplings.                                                
                                                "The city government is close to delivering on its promise of planting two crore saplings in the national capital in five years," he said.
                                                "Before the state elections, we promised to plant two crore saplings. We planted 32 lakh in 2020-21, 35 lakh in 2021-2022, 50 lakh in 2022-23 and the target for 2023-24 is 52 lakh,"
                                                 the minister added.</p>

                                        <h4>‘Uncharted territory’: UN declares first week of July world’s hottest ever recorded</h4>
                                        <p>The beginning of July was the hottest week on record for the planet as a whole, according to the World Meteorological Organization. This year had already seen the hottest June on record, the UN body said, driven by climate change and the early stages of an El Niño weather pattern.
                                                It is the latest in a series of records halfway through a year that has seen a drought in Spain and fierce heatwaves in China as well as the US.                                            
                                                “The world just had the hottest week on record, according to preliminary data,” the WMO said in a statement, adding that temperatures were breaking records on land and in the oceans, with “potentially devastating impacts on ecosystems and the environment”.                                                                                              
                                                A flooded area in Ludlow, Vermont on Monday.
                                                US faces deadly floods in north-east and longer heatwaves in south and west                                               
                                                “We are in uncharted territory and we can expect more records to fall as El Niño develops further and these impacts will extend into 2024,” said Christopher Hewitt, WMO director of climate services.                       
                                                “This is worrying news for the planet.”                                                
                                                Global sea surface temperatures were at record highs for the time of the year both in May and June, said Hewitt. “It is not only the surface temperature, but the whole ocean is becoming warmer and absorbing energy that will remain there for hundreds of years.”</p>

                                <h4>Uganda oil pipeline has ‘devastated’ livelihoods, says HRW</h4>
                                <p>A planned oil pipeline to help Uganda export its crude to international markets has “devastated” the lives of thousands of people who have experienced delayed or inadequate compensation for their land, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Monday.
                                        The rights group also said the project, in which TotalEnergies has a 62 percent stake, 
                                        is a disaster for the planet as it will add emissions that exacerbate climate change.France’s TotalEnergies rejected HRW’s accusations, saying it was respecting all the rights of affected people.
                                        Planned at a cost of $3.5bn, the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) will carry crude from oilfields in Uganda’s west through Tanzania to the Indian Ocean seaport of Tanga, a length of 1,445km (898 miles).
                                       Preliminary ground work began earlier this year and the pipeline is scheduled for completion in 2025.</p>

                                <h4>Environment Friendly Cremation</h4>
                                <p>Death is an inevitable part of human’s existence. Death as a phenomenon has piqued interest and has perplexed humanity across generations. As soon as a human die, it is important to cremate the body at the earliest. 

                                        Throughout the history, cremation is a practice that has been carried out by various cultures as a method of handling the deceased.
                                         It is the process of reducing a body to its basic elements through intense heat, typically in a cremation chamber or furnace.
                                         The practice of cremation, the process of reducing a body to its basic elements through burning, has a long and varied history that spans cultures and civilisations.
                                          While the specific origins of cremation are difficult to trace, evidence suggests that the practice dates back thousands of years.Cremation can be traced back to ancient civilisations such as the Stone Age,
                                           with archaeological evidence indicating that early humans used fire to dispose of their dead.</p>

                                <h4>EU faces cliffhanger vote on major bill protecting nature and fighting climate change</h4>
                                <p>rotesters and legislators converged on the European Union parliament Tuesday as the bloc faces a major vote on protecting its threatened nature and shielding it from disruptive environmental change,
                                 in a test of the EU's global climate credentials.Spurred on by climate activist Greta Thunberg, hundreds of demonstrators were set to demand that the EU pushes through a bill to beef up the restoration 
                                 of nature in the 27-nation bloc that was damaged during decades of industrial expansion.Inside the legislature in Strasbourg, France, parliamentarians were bracing ahead of Wednesday's vote for a brutal debate over whether to push the plan off the table. The legislature's environment committee last month was deadlocked at 44-44 on it.
                                 “We urge them to not reject it but vote for the strongest law possible. To mitigate the climate crisis and halt biodiversity loss, we must #RestoreNature,” Thunberg wrote on her Twitter feed.
                                 The bill is a key part of the EU's vaunted European Green Deal that seeks to establish the world's most ambitious climate and biodiversity targets and make the bloc the global point of reference on all climate issues. The plans proposed by the EU's executive commission set binding restoration targets for specific habitats and species,
                                  with the aim by 2030 to cover at least 20 per cent of the region's land and sea areas.</p>

                                        <h4>Is Vedanta’s Sterlite Copper plant in Tamil Nadu set for reopening?</h4>
                                        <p>Nearly five years after the Tamil Nadu government had sealed the Vedanta group’s Sterlite Copper smelting plant in Thoothukudi, prospects of its reopening have brightened. After reports suggested that Vedanta had shelved plans
                                                 to sell the plant, full-page newspaper advertisements have appeared in the state since February 17 to advocate the reopening.
                                                ‘Give back our livelihoods’, screams the advertisement and points out that the copper smelting plant had provided livelihood to scores of people in Thoothukudi for 22 years until the state government shut it in May 2018.
                                                 It also listed various reasons favouring reopening of the plant, but stopped short of saying that was indeed being done.
                                                 The appeal to give livelihoods back cited that hundreds of thousands of people were jobless and suffering, that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had affirmed the copper factory’s environmental practices, that Sterlite Copper had produced medical oxygen to help during the Covid pandemic, and that the project had spawned opportunities for the growth of many small businesses. Further, the ad stated that the government had also suffered huge revenue loss due to the closure. “We have fallen prey to Chinese economic terrorism, which has led to economic downfall. But there has been no fall but a rise in pollution levels at the four monitoring stations in the Sterlite Copper neighbourhood after its closure,” Manickam Athapa Gounder, industrialist and founder president, Manu Neethi Foundation,
                                                  one of the entities that has endorsed the advertisement.</p>

                                        <h4>NGO that organised protests against Vedanta Sterlite plant in Thoothukudi under scrutiny: Home Ministry tells Rajya Sabha </h4>
                                        <p>The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) informed the Rajya Sabha on April 5, that it was examining complaints against an NGO— The Other Media— for misusing foreign funds to organise protests and demonstrations around Vedanta’s 
                                                Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi, in Tamil Nadu.Responding to a question by Congress party’s Naranbhai J. Rathwa, Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai said in a written reply, that it had received some representation and complaints alleging violation of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA) by the New Delhi-based NGO
                                                “Inputs of field agency have also been received. In such cases, a standard questionnaire is issued to the association seeking detailed information and the same is examined in terms of provisions of the FCRA, 2010 and rules made there under,” the reply said.
                                                “Accordingly, standard questionnaire was issued to the association and reply has been received. In case violations of provisions of the FCRA, 2010 are found, the certificate of FCRA registration of the association may be cancelled under Section 14 of the Act,” the reply stated.During the last three financial years— 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22, foreign contribution of ₹3.54 crore was received and ₹2.79 crore was utilised by the association.
                                                The copper plant owned by business baron Anil Agarwal was shut down in 2018 after 13 people died in police

                                        <h4>SC Stays Delhi LG's Appointment as the Head of Panel on Yamuna River Pollution</h4>
                                        <p>The National Green Tribunal issued an order on January 9 naming Delhi LG as the chairman of a high-level committee on Yamuna river pollution.
                                         The Delhi government moved the court with a plea that a domain expert should head the panel in the place of LG.The court issued its ruling after the Delhi government, through its counsel A.M. Singhvi, noted that a governor let alone an LG cannot be made chief of such a committee. Instead, Singhvi said, a domain expert should head such a panel, according to Livelaw.in. 
                                         “There shall be a stay of the operation on the direction of NGT to the extent that the LG has been asked to be the head. We are not staying the entire order,” Chef Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said, referring to the NGT order.                                        
                                         The Delhi government’s plea against the NGT order also reflected the ongoing tussle between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led government and the LG, who reports to the Union home ministry, over the authority of services in Delhi.                                
                                         The plea has once reiterated the Delhi government’s position that LG is “only a nominal figurehead except in areas of police, order, and land”, and added that executive powers in all areas relating to local governance lie 
                                         “exclusively” with the state government.</p>
